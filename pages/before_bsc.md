**Before in academic endeavours: BSc Thesis**

??-08-2024 I recently finished writing my BSc Thesis in Cultural Anthropology & Development Sociology!! It's titled *Talking About Sex Robots: Mapping academic controversy in sex robot discourse*. Using the methodology of controversy mapping, I looked at the academic conversations and debates that have been happening around sex robots since 2007. Specifically, I look into the ways in which some arguments (made by people who oppose sex robots) resemble arguments made by second-wave anti-pornography feminists and hide transphobic/anti-sex worker beliefs underneath. You can download and read it on [researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382625206_Talking_About_Sex_Robots_Mapping_academic_controversy_in_sex_robot_discourse), or you can email me (address at the bottom of the page) and I'll send it over to you.

09-11-2024 Davecat, who I interviewed for the thesis, recently wrote some of his thoughts about my thesis on his blog! You can read it [here](http://www.kuroneko-chan.com/echoes/?p=6748), and I'd reccomend reading some of his other blog posts too!
