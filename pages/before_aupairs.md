#### Before in academic endeavours: Fieldwork 2022-2023: The Care of an Au Pair

As part of my degree in CADS, we complete a year long self-created ethnographic research project, on a topic of our choice. Together with Lila, Annika, and Benjam√≠n, we studied au pairs living in the Netherlands, the work that they do, and the ways in which they are treated in their time as an au pair. From this we created a 50 page research report, finding that the mismatched expectations of those involved in the au pair industry caused a great deal of harm for everyone involved (but mainly au pairs).
As a result of this, we're creating a website collating resources for au pairs and aspiring host families, with the aim of encouraging realistic expectations about their time and being able to get help if they need it. You can find the website [here, @ https://thecareofanaupair.github.io](https://thecareofanaupair.github.io).
