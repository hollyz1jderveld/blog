## My first ever blog post!
Well, definitely not my first *ever*, as I held a number of blogs throughout my teenage years... **but** I've coded this one mainly by myself! And I'm writing it on Logseq??? Thank you [Shiva](https://gl0bsec.github.io/) for helping me out with all of it.

Well, now I can waffle on about whatever I so please. And I most certainly will. I sometimes consume media about the internet back when I was young and I find having a personal blog so interesting, a place on the internet that someone made by themselves, instead of being mediated by a social media. Or even social medias like tumblr or livejournal. So this was all a driver to creating this blog. I'm not sure who will read it, as it's not swimming in a sea of roughly 60 second videos, but I don't mind. Maybe someone can stumble across it and enjoy it, but probably not because no way am I going to make it seo optimised.

I know right now I'm just rambling, and that's fine, but I do plan to write about lots of things on here, probably to do with my hobbies and academic interests. I think that this is enough of a post right now (as I'm still doing some configuring with the blog) but that should be all good! I will insert a photo from wikimedia commons though, for fun (and testing).
